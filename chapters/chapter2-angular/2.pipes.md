## Pipes

- Pipes allow you to transform values in templates before they are outputed to the view.
- Pipes were formerly known as filters in Angular 1.x
- A pipe is defined using the `@pipe` class decorator
- The pipe decorator takes name as a parameter defining the name of the pipe: `@pipe({ name: 'myPipe' })`
- Every pipe class has a `transform` method that transforms input to outputs:
    - The first parameter is the input to the pipe
    - The second parameter is the list of arguments passed to the pipe
- Give the following pipe in a template: `{{ data | somePipe:1:'px'}}`:
    - `data` is the input to pipe --  the first parameter of the transform method
    - `[1, 'px']` is the arguments to the pipe -- the second parameter of the transform method
- A pipe can be as simple as:

    ```typescript
    @pipe({name: 'simplePipe'})
    class MyPipe {
      transform(input, args) { return input + 'px'; }
    }
    ```

- If you want to use a pipe, you need to register your pipe class with the components in the pipes array:

    ```typescript
    @component({
      selector: '...',
      pipes: [MyPipe] // adding pipe to the array of pipes.
    })
    class MyComponent {}
    ```

- Pipes can be chained: `input | pipe1 | pipe2 | pipe3 `
    - `input | pipe1 : output1`
    - `output1 | pipe2: output2`
    - `output2 | pipe3 : finalOutput`

### Basic Pipe

Let's make a basic pipe called `pixel` that takes a value as the input and appends 'px' to the end of it. The project files for this section are in [angular2-intro/project-files/angular-examples/pipes/basic-pipe](https://github.com/st32lth/angular2-intro/tree/master/project-files/angular-examples/pipes/basic-pipe).

Start by making a copy of the "starter" folder and call it "basic-pipe" and put it in `project-files/angular-examples`. Then, open the folder in VSCode: `code project-files/angular-examples/basic-pipe` and start the build with `command + shift + b`.

Then, create a file for the pipe and call it `pixel.pipe.ts` in the root of the project.

After that we need to do couple of things to define the pipe:

- Import the Pipe Class Metadata from angular core: `import {Pipe} from 'Angular/core'`
- Then create a class defining the Pipe:

    ```typescript
    class PixelPipe {

    }
    ```

- Implement the `transform` method in the class:

    ```typescript
    class PixelPipe {
      transform(input) {
        return input + 'px';
      }
    }
    ```

- After implementing the method, we need to decorate the class and give the pipe a name that we want to use in our templates:

    ```typescript
    @Pipe({name: 'pixel'}) // <- adding the decorator
    class PixelPipe {
      transform(input) {
        return input + 'px';
      }
    }
    ```

- As the last step we are going to export the class by putting the `export` keyword behind the class:

    ```typescript
    ...
    export class PixelPipe {
      ...
    }
    ```

Now, your file should look like the following:

```typescript
import {Pipe} from 'angular2/core';
@Pipe({name: 'pixel'}) // <- adding the decorator
export class PixelPipe {
  transform(input) {
    return input + 'px';
  }
}
```

Now, let's go back to the `main.ts` file and import our pipe:

```typescript
import {Component} from 'angular2/core';
import {bootstrap} from 'angular2/platform/browser';
import {PixelPipe} from './pixel.pipe'; // <- importing pipe
```

After importing our pipe, we should register it with our component by adding it to the `pipes` array:

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app',
  templateUrl : 'templates/app.tpl.html',
  pipes: [PixelPipe] // <- registering the pipe
})
```

Now that we have registered the pipe, we can use it in our template in `templates/app.tpl.html`:

```html
<h1>{{ name }}</h1>
<p>Pixel value: {{ 25 | pixel }}</p>
```

You should be all set now. You can set the url in your `launch.json` file and hit F5:

```json
...
"url": "http://localhost:8080/project-files/angular-examples/basic-pipe/index.html",
...
```

If your server is running you should be able to see the following output:

### Chaining Pipes

Let's continue where we left off with the "pixelPipe" and add another pipe called "round" that rounds down given values, that is:

```
25.3 | round | pixel -> 25px
```

The project files for this section are in [angular2-intro/project-files/angular-examples/pipes/pipe-chaining](https://github.com/st32lth/angular2-intro/tree/master/project-files/angular-examples/pipes/pipe-chaining).

We are going to add the "roundFilter" to our "basic-pipe" project. Let's get started by adding the `round.pipe.ts` file in the root of the project:

```typescript
import {Pipe} from 'angular2/core';
@Pipe({name: 'round'})
export class RoundPipe {
  transform (input) {
    return Math.floor(+input); // <- convert input to number and then floor it.
  }
}
```

This Pipe is not complicated at all. We are just returning the floor of the input. We are also converting the input to number by putting a `+` before input.

Now, let's import the pipe into our `main.ts` file:

```typescript
import {Component} from 'angular2/core';
import {bootstrap} from 'angular2/platform/browser';
import {PixelPipe} from './pixel.pipe';
import {RoundPipe} from './round.pipe'; // <- importing `RoundPipe`
```

and then we have to add the pipe to the list of pipe array:

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app',
  templateUrl : 'templates/app.tpl.html',
  pipes: [PixelPipe, RoundPipe] // <- registering the pipe
})
```

after that we are going to add the following to our `templates/app.tpl.html` file:

```html
<p>Pixel value: {{ 34.4 | round | pixel }}</p>
```

After running the app you should see `34.px` as the output on the page.
