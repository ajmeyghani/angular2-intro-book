## Change Detection

- In Angular2 you can limit the change detection scope to components
- Using `chageDection` property we can choose a change detection strategy for a component
- The `changeDetection` field accept one of the following values:

    - `ChangeDetectionStrategy.Default`: sets detector mode to `CheckAlways`
    - `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`: sets detector mode to `CheckOnce`. This will limit change detection to the bindings affecting the component only
    - `ChangeDetectionStrategy.Detached`: change detector sub tree is not a part of the main tree and should be skipped
    - `ChangeDetectionStrategy.CheckAlways`: after calling detectChanges the mode of the change detector will remain `CheckAlways`
    - `ChangeDetectionStrategy.Checked`: change detector should be skipped until its mode changes to `CheckOnce`
    - `ChangeDetectionStrategy.CheckOnce`: after calling detectChanges the mode of the change detector will become `Checked`

- Having the ability to specify change detection strategy can reduce the number of checks and improve app's performance
