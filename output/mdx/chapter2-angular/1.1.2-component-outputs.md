### Component Output/Events

- Events can be emitted from components. These events can be either custom or they could be DOM events
- The syntax is `(eventname)="fn()"` where `eventname` is the name of the event and `fn` is the handler function
- The handler function is called when the event is fired
- For example, if you want to handle a click event you can do: `(click)="handler()"`. In this case the `hander` is called whenever the click event is fired off
- You can use Angular's `EventEmitter` to fire off custom events

#### Custom Output Events

**Project Files**

The project files for this section are in [angular2-intro/project-files/angular-examples/component-output-events](https://github.com/st32lth/angular2-intro/tree/master/project-files/angular-examples/component-output-events).

**Final Result**

The goal of this section is to show you how to create a component that contains a button that when is clicked, calls a handler defined by the component's class. The final html will look like the following:

~~~~{.numberLines .html startFrom="1"}
<p>Value: {{ value }}</p>
<button (click)=addOne()>Add +</button>
~~~~~~~

That idea is very simple: every time we click on the button we want to increment the value by one. In addition to that, we want to be able to hook into a custom event and run the `addOne` method whenever the event is fired:

~~~~{.numberLines .html startFrom="1"}
<p>Value: {{ value }}</p>
<span adder-auto (myevent)=addOne()>adding ...</span>
~~~~~~~

**Getting Started**

Let's get started by defining our `Adder` component:

~~~~{.numberLines .java startFrom="1"}
@Component({
  selector: 'adder',
  template:`
  <p>Value: {{ value }}</p>
  <button (click)=addOne()>Add +</button>
  `
})
class Adder {
  private value: number;
  constructor() {
    this.value = 0;
  }
  addOne() {
  this.value += 1;
  console.log(this.value);
  }
}
~~~~~~~

Now, we are just going to register `Adder` with our root component:

~~~~{.numberLines .java startFrom="1"}
@Component({
  selector: 'app',
  directives: [Adder],
  template: '<adder></adder>'
})
class App {}
~~~~~~~

after you bootstrap the app and run it you should be able to see a button that when clicked increments the value by one.

**Using EventEmitter**

Now, let's see how we can use the `EventEmitter` to increment the value by one every time a custom event is fired every second. In order to achieve that, we are going to create an attribute directive called `AdderAuto`. Start by importing the `Directive` metadata class:

~~~~{.numberLines .java startFrom="1"}
import {Directive} from 'angular2/core';
~~~~~~~

and then define the selector for the directive:

~~~~{.numberLines .java startFrom="1"}
@Directive({
  selector: '[adder-auto]'
})
~~~~~~~

- `selector: '[adder-auto]'` means that angular will target any element that has the `adder-auto` attribute and will create an instance of the class. Now we need to define the class for our directive:

~~~~{.numberLines .java startFrom="1"}
class AdderAuto {
  // custom event definition
}
~~~~~~~

In this class we need to define a custom event output hook. We are going to call it `myevent`. The same way that you can hook into `(click)`, we want to be able to use `(myevent)`. To achieve that, we need to create an instance variable and decorate it with the `Output` decorator:

~~~~{.numberLines .java startFrom="1"}
// -> importing `EventEmitter` and `Output` decorator.
import {EventEmitter, Output} from 'angular2/core';
class AdderAuto {
  @Output() myevent: EventEmitter<string>;
  constructor() {
    this.myevent = new EventEmitter();
  }
}
~~~~~~~

- If you notice, `myevent` is of type `EventEmitter` that emit events of type string
- In the constructor we are creating an instance of `EventEmitter`. So now we can use `myevent` to emit events
- We can use `setInterval` to emit event from our custom event every second

~~~~{.numberLines .java startFrom="1"}
class AdderAuto {
  @Output() myevent: EventEmitter<string>;
  constructor() {
    this.myevent = new EventEmitter();
    setInterval(()=> {this.myevent.emit('myevename')}, 1000);
  }
}
~~~~~~~

Now we can register `AdderAuto` with the `Adder` component and run the `addOne` method every second:

~~~~{.numberLines .java startFrom="1"}
@Component({
  selector: 'adder',
  ...
  directives: [AdderAuto] // <- register `AdderAuto`
})
~~~~~~~

and then we can update the template:

~~~~{.numberLines .html startFrom="1"}
<p>Value: {{ value }}</p>
<button (click)="addOne()">Add +</button>
<!-- using the event. -->
<h2>Using Emitter</h2>
<span adder-auto (myevent)="addOne($event)"> EVENT: </span>
~~~~~~~

- first we are adding the attribute directive `adder-auto` on the span
- second, we are using the `myevent` hook and attaching `addOne` handler to it. This means that whenever the `myevent` event is triggered, run the `addOne` handler.

The `Adder` component now looks like the following with the updated template:

~~~~{.numberLines .java startFrom="1"}
@Component({
  selector: 'adder',
  template:`
  <p>Value: {{ value }}</p>
  <button (click)="addOne()">Add +</button>
  <h2>Using Emitter</h2>
  <span adder-auto (myevent)="addOne($event)"> EVENT: </span>
  `,
  directives: [AdderAuto]
})
~~~~~~~

Now if you run the code, you should be able to see the number incrementing by one every second.

#### Binding to DOM Events

In addition to custom output events, we can bind to almost all of the native DOM events. Below you can find some common events with examples:

**Inputs**

- [keyup](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/keyup)

    ~~~~{.numberLines .html startFrom="1"}
    <input type="text" #inputField2 (keyup)="setInputFieldValue2(inputField2.value)">
    <pre> {{ keyupValue }}</pre>
    ~~~~~~~

- [input](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/input)


    ~~~~{.numberLines .html startFrom="1"}
    <input type="text" #inputField (input)="setInputFieldValue(inputField.value)">
    <pre> {{ inputValue }}</pre>
    ~~~~~~~

**Mouse**

- [click](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/click)

    ~~~~{.numberLines .html startFrom="1"}
    <button (click)="sayHello()"> Say Hello! </button>
    <pre>{{ hello }}</pre>
    ~~~~~~~

- [dblclick](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/dblclick)

    ~~~~{.numberLines .html startFrom="1"}
    <button (dblclick)="sayDoubleHello()"> Say Hello! </button>
    <pre>{{ doubleHello }}</pre>
    ~~~~~~~

- [mousedown](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/mousedown)

    ~~~~{.numberLines .html startFrom="1"}
    <button (mousedown)="sayDownHello()">Say Hello !</button>
    <pre>{{ downHello }}</pre>
    ~~~~~~~

- [mouseup](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/mouseup)

    ~~~~{.numberLines .html startFrom="1"}
    <button (mouseup)="sayUpHello()">Say Hello !</button>
    <pre>{{ upHello }}</pre>
    ~~~~~~~

- [mouseenter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/mouseenter)

    ~~~~{.numberLines .html startFrom="1"}
    <h2 (mouseenter)="sayEnterHello()" (mouseleave)="clearEnterHello()">Mouseenter/leave</h2>
    <pre>{{ enterHello }}</pre>
    ~~~~~~~

- [mouseleave](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/mouseleave)

    ~~~~{.numberLines .html startFrom="1"}
    <h2 (mouseenter)="sayEnterHello()" (mouseleave)="clearEnterHello()">Mouseenter/leave</h2>
    <pre>{{ enterHello }}</pre>
    ~~~~~~~

#### Event Delegation/Bubbling

When an event is raised by an element, by default it bubbles up the html hierarchy. For example, if you have a table and attached a click handler to the table itself, you can catch the row that was clicked by only attaching a single handler. This method is useful when you are dealing with situations where you don't want to attach event handlers to every elements, and you just want to attach one. Below is an example of event delegation, detecting the row that was clicked on the table:

~~~~{.numberLines .html startFrom="1"}
<pre>{{rowClicked}}</pre>

<table (click)="catchBubbledEvent($event)">
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4</td>
  </tr>
</table>
~~~~~~~

Notice how we have a single `click` handler only on the table itself. The `$event` is the bubbled event that we can catch to do interesting stuff with. In this case we are just reading the `textContent` from the target: `event.target.textContent`:

~~~~{.numberLines .java startFrom="1"}
catchBubbledEvent(event) {
  this.rowClicked = event.target.nodeName === 'TD' ? event.target.textContent : '';
}
~~~~~~~

In the method above we are checking if a `td` was clicked on. If so, we set the `this.rowClicked` to the td's value, otherwise we set it to an empty string.
