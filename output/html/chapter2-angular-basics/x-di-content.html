<h2 id="dependency-injection">Dependency Injection</h2>
<p>Dependency Injection is a coding pattern in which a class receives its dependencies from external sources rather than creating them itself. In order to achieve Dependency Injection we need a Dependency InjectionFramework to handle the dependencies for us. Using a DI framework, you simply ask for a class from the injector instead of worrying about the dependencies inside the class itself.</p>
<p>Angular has a standalone module that handles Dependency Injection. This framework can also be used in non-Angular applications to handle Dependency Injection.</p>
